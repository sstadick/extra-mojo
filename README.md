# ⚡ ExtraMojo ⚡

Extra functionality to extend the Mojo std lib.

*Supports mojo 25.1.0*

## Documentation and Examples

[ExtraMojo Docs](https://extramojo.github.io/ExtraMojo/)

Also see any of the tests in the `test_*.mojo` files.

## Install / Usage

Add `https://repo.prefix.dev/modular-community` to your project channels:

```
# mojoproject.toml or pixi.toml

[project]
channels = ["conda-forge", "https://conda.modular.com/max", "https://repo.prefix.dev/modular-community"]
description = "Add a short description here"
name = "my-mojo-project"
platforms = ["osx-arm64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
max = ">=25.1.0,<26"
```

then run:

```bash
magic add ExtraMojo
```

Or directly by following these instructions.

See docs for [numojo](https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo/tree/v0.3?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install) and just do that for this package until Mojo has true package / library support.

tl;dr;

In your project `mojo run -I "../ExtraMojo" my_example_file.mojo`.
Note the bit about how to add this project to your LSP so things resolve in VSCode.
